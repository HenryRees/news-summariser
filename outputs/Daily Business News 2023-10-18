[Pause HS2 land sale, says government big projects adviser](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67141579)

The UK government has been advised to suspend land sale procured for phase 2 of HS2 for up to three years by its independent infrastructure consultant. Sir John Armitt expressed concern that proposed government plans could exacerbate rail travel congestion between Birmingham and Manchester. The government has been charged with sabotaging the project after axing the HS2 link to Manchester and making a decision to sell properties that were initially bought in preparation for the extended line. Sir John urged government reconsider its decision, advocating for a full evaluation of the government's proposal, Network North, which was to divert the funds to several alternative local projects.
