[Charities 'concerned' over lack of progress with Renters Reform Bill](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67118261)

Thirty charities and non-profit organisations, including Shelter, are urging UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to pass the Renters Reform Bill, which would ban "no-fault" evictions, requiring landlords to present legitimate reasons for eviction. The proposed bill offers more stability and certainty to renters as it abolishes the right of landlords to evict tenants without cause with only two months' notice. Housing charity Shelter states that a renter is evicted every three minutes under the no-fault rule, causing social isolation, financial hardship and negative impacts on mental health. The charities express concern that the bill may not be passed before the next general election, and highlight that delays could cause more unnecessary hardship and larger taxpayer costs.


[Citibank wins case after sacking banker over two-sandwich lunch claim](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67121456)

Citibank won an employment tribunal following the sacking of staff member Szabolcs Fekete, who was accused of claiming expenses for meals shared with his partner and lying about it. Mr Fekete, who had worked as an analyst for Citi for seven years, was dismissed for gross misconduct after his manager questioned the validity of his expense claim following a business trip. When the bank’s security and investigations department also questioned him, Mr Fekete initially denied sharing meals with his partner before later admitting to it. Taking Citi to court for unfair and wrongful dismissal, he lost his case, with Employment Judge Illing stating, "it is significant that the claimant did not make a full and frank disclosure at the first opportunity and that he did not answer questions directly."


[Australia fines X for failing to crack down on child abuse content](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67119677)

Australia's internet safety watchdog has fined Elon Musk's company, Twitter, A$610,500 ($386,000; £317,360) for its failure to cooperate in a probe regarding anti-child abuse practices. The fine follows Musk's earlier comment that "removing child exploitation is priority #1", and criticism from the eSafety Commission for the firm's lack of action. Twitter also failed to respond to several key questions regarding the handling of child sexual exploitation on its platform. This comes after Twitter confirmed to the regulator that it had cut 80% of its global workforce, and no longer has public policy staff in Australia, following Musk's $44bn acquisition of the company last year.
