[What is the UK inflation rate and why is it so high?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12196322)

The UK's inflation rate fell to 6.7% in the year to August, mainly due to slowed food inflation. However, food price rises remain high at 13.6%, sparked by demand for oil and gas after Covid, increased global food prices due to conflict in Ukraine, and UKâ€™s vegetable shortage. In response to the above-inflation rates, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, encouraging fewer customer purchases and business borrowing to slow inflation. Despite concerns over the nation's high inflation rates, data shows that pay excluding bonuses has grown more than inflation for the first time in two years.
