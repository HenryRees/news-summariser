[Electric cars drive UK MG sales to more than £1bn](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67115975)

MG Motors, a Chinese owned brand, has seen strong growth in the UK posting sales worth over £1bn in 2022, more than doubling due to increased demand for their electric and hybrid vehicles. Pre-tax profits reached £54.2m in 2022, dramatically up from £4.3m in the previous year. The growth comes as Chinese firms, heavily subsidised by the state, are increasing production of electric cars and batteries. Car models MG ZS, MG 5, and HS PHEV contributed significantly to the sales, and more vehicles are set to be released in 2024.


[Citibank wins after sacking banker over two-sandwich lunch claim](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67121456)

Citibank has won a case against former worker Szabolcs Fekete who claimed unfair dismissal following his termination for gross misconduct relating to expense claims. Fekete, a former analyst with the bank, filed expense claims for meals including sandwiches and coffees which he asserted were consumed during a 2019 business trip to Amsterdam. The bank challenged the accuracy of the claims, which ultimately revealed that Fekete’s partner had shared some of the meals. While the expense claim was within the bank’s €100 daily limit, the judge found the issue lay in Fekete’s conduct rather than the amounts involved, including not making a “full and frank disclosure at the first opportunity”.
