Retail sales in the UK fell by 0.9% in September, a greater drop than the 0.2% economists had predicted, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The fall was attributed to unseasonably warm weather which reduced the sale of autumn clothing lines, along with cost of living pressures preventing people from buying expensive items like furniture and watches. However, the warm weather has also boosted food sales slightly, and fuel sales rebounded from a fall in August. As the festive season approaches, retailers hope easing inflation might improve consumer confidence, while acknowledging the uncertainties posed by rising business rates and global crises.

UK government borrowing for September was lower than expected at £14.3bn but remains high, being the sixth highest since records commenced in 1993; this is prompting calls for well-targeted tax cuts in the forthcoming Autumn Statement. However, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has downplayed the possibility of near-term tax cuts, stating that the government must prioritize bringing down inflation. Government spending on debt interest has doubled since last year, a situation Hunt calls unsustainable, with higher interest rates potentially costing between £20bn - £30bn p.a. Nevertheless, the current spending figures, combined with the decrease in government debt interest and increased income from tax and national insurance, show how quickly the government's financial headroom can stretch or contract when economic or political factors change.

Moody's credit rating agency has lifted its negative outlook on the UK, citing policy predictability and a more "conciliatory" approach to EU trade discussions. The decision has been influenced by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's move to reverse a majority of his predecessor's tax cuts. While Brexit-associated friction has reportedly slowed the fight against inflation, Moody's anticipates the return of a 2% inflation target in 2026. Meanwhile, Fitch, another rating agency, maintains a negative outlook on the UK, with its next assessment due on 1 December.

[Prepayment fears delaying smart meter roll-out, warn MPs](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67161140)

Fears of being forcibly switched to prepayment energy meters may be deterring customers from getting smart meters, according to MPs. The UK government previously set a goal for all homes to have smart meters installed by 2019 to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, but as of March 2021, only 57% did. A recent public spending report recognised the progress of smart meter roll-out, stating the potential savings of around £50 annually. However, it was found that approximately 3 million smart meters were not functioning properly, and parts for 7 million may need replacement due to changes in mobile networks.
