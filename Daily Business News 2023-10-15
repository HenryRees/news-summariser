[Electric cars drive UK MG sales to more than £1bn](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67115975)

MG Motors, owned by China's SAIC Motor Corp, experienced a boom in UK sales worth over £1bn ($1.3bn) in 2022 due to increased demands for electric and hybrid vehicles. The firm's pre-tax profits also increased significantly, totalling £54.2m ($70.7m) for 2022, compared with £4.3m ($5.6m) in the previous year. This comes as Chinese companies gain dominance in the electric vehicle industry, backed by state subsidies and rising global demand. Despite a delay in the UK's ban on new petrol and diesel car sales from 2030 to 2035, MG Motors said it is strongly positioned to benefit from a shift towards electric cars over the next 10-15 years.
