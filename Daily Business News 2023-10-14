[Microsoft in $29bn back taxes dispute in US](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67085704)

Microsoft is challenging a demand from the US tax authority to pay an additional $28.9 billion in back taxes for the years 2004 to 2013. This follows an Internal Revenue Service audit of how Microsoft distributes profits among different jurisdictions. Microsoft insists its current tax practices are not in question. The software giant believes the amount owed will drop by $10 billion due to tax laws passed by former President Trump, and reassures that they have always paid the due taxes in the US and globally.


[Interest rates expected to be held after small economic growth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67084533)

The UK economy displayed marginal growth of 0.2% for August, which was driven by education and the IT sectors, following a sharp fall in July. This has fueled the expectation that interest rates will be left unchanged again in the upcoming month, after ending 14 consecutive rise streak, now held at 5.25%. Analysts however have described the economic figures as "lacklustre", with higher borrowing costs and the high cost of living being seen as burdens on both consumers and businesses. Experts warn that recession prospects still remain due to the lingering effects of prior rate hikes and the strain on budgets, while others suggest the current economic status indicates a period of stagflation.

Microsoft has completed its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, making it the largest deal ever in the gaming industry. As a part of the deal, Microsoft has transferred the rights to distribute Activision's games on consoles and PCs over the cloud to French video game publisher Ubisoft. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved the deal, stating it would result in more choice and better services for gamers. However, Microsoft has faced criticism for its conduct during negotiations and for initially presenting deal terms that were not approved by the regulator.

[JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon warns world facing 'most dangerous time in decades'](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67104734)

JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has warned of the most dangerous economic situation in decades due to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly conflicts in Ukraine and Israel. He voiced concern about potential impacts on energy and food prices, as well as global trade and geopolitical relationships. Despite the bank reporting impressive $13bn profit over the past quarter, bolstered by healthy US household and business finances, he expressed caution over persistently high interest rates and inflation. Dimon, known for his straightforward views on political matters, strongly condemned the attacks by Hamas and expressed support for Israel.


[US car strike escalates as expands to Ford's biggest plant](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67085700)

The United Auto Workers (UAW) have expanded their ongoing strike, involving Ford's largest plant and about a fifth of total auto workers. The action follows Ford's refusal to further move contract negotiations, escalating the dispute that began in September against Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. The strike marks the first time in the union's 88-year history that all three Detroit automakers have been targeted at once. With the automotive industry accounting for 3% of the national economy, this broad labour unrest adds a layer of uncertainty over the sector's future.
