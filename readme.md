# News article project

## Project Overview

This project uses OpenAi's api to summarise news articles scrapped from BBC News Business. The types of articles can summarised can be adjusted to suit the users preferences. The objective of the project was to produce 1 page daily news briefing that would allow me to quickly absorb relevant current news while also having the ability to access full articles if I so wished.
